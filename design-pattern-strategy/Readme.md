# Strategy design pattern

The goal is to have different encapsulated algorithms and logics to change the behavior between one logic and another. The function that uses the objects or interfaces remains unchanged.

This is a battle example of pokemon game.

On this example, the executeAttack funcion receives myAttack and foeAttack which are two different strategies to attack.
